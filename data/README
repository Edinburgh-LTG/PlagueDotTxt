This directory contains the source data compiled and used as part of the Plague.TXT project.

The Third Plague Pandemic was documented in over 100 outbreak reports for most major citiesaround the world.  Many of them have been digitised, converted to text via optical characterrecognition (OCR) and are available via the Internet Archive and the UK Medical HeritageLibrary.

In this Github repository we are releasing details and download links (if available) for the works that are part of this corpus.
